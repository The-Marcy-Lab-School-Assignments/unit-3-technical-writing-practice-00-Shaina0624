### Goal: Write your own “documentation” for the higher order functions
**Your documentation should include:**
- A description of the purpose
*A higher order funtion is a function that takes in another function as an argument and sometimes returns a function.
- A description of the syntax
We declare a function using a variable
We take in two parameters where one argument is a function
Within the brackets we have our code
- An example
```js
  const Jacqueline => (music,code){
  return code + music;
  }
```
- An explanation of the example
We took in two parameter and added them together and returned it
- Any additional notes/details
